System for Delivery Drone | OCaml, Functional Programming

• Design of an autonomous mission management software kernel (loading, navigation by coordinates, delivery and return base).

• Security-oriented architecture: Use of strong static typing to eliminate logic errors during execution and ensure secure flight state transitions.

• Algorithmic: Implementation of decision logic and management of the parcel and destination database.

• Valorization: Application of the principles of functional programming to critical computing (aerospace sector).
